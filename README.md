### Interfaces to integrate with Tela ERP framework ###

#### C# development of a project based on Tela ERP framework ####

You typically include the project **ITela** into your C# projects to conveniently use / share your codelists in the [Oasis Genericode](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/codelist/) way. See the project **fronteranet-interface** as an example how it used ITela.

We advise you to create most of your codelists as subsets of those offered by [UBL 2.1](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/). In Tela.Gc.Data we will list all UBL code lists. You'll typically have a web service use Tela.Gc.Data and propose code values not in your main project.
